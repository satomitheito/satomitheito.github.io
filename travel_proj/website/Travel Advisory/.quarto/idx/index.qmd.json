Its travel advisory system is specifically designed to inform U.S. citizens about potential risks when traveling abroad, not domestic travels. ([Travel Advisories](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html))\n\n\n## Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions \n\n\nOut of the four levels,[@cr-map]{pan-to=\"60%, 15%\" scale-by=\"1.8\"}countries in this category have received the <b style=\"color:#9be7c4;\">lowest advisory level</b> from the U.S. Department of State, advising travelers to exercise standard precautions.

It's crucial to assess whether travel is necessary and to take additional precautions. On March 21, 2025, <b style=\"color:#ffa600;\">Niger</b> was renewed at a Level 3 'Reconsider Travel' advisory due to elevated risks of violent crime, terrorism, kidnapping, civil unrest, and limited access to medical care, particularly near border regions ([Niger Travel Advisory](https://ne.usembassy.gov/republic-of-niger-level-3-reconsider-travel/)).\n\n\n## Level 4: Do Not Travel\n\nOut of the four advisory levels, [@cr-map]{pan-to=\"-20%,40%\" scale-by=\"2.6\"} countries at this level have received the <b style=\"color:#ff0000;\">highest advisory level</b> by the U.S. Department of State.

As of June 27, 2024, <b style=\"color:#ff0000;\">Russia</b> was reissued a Level 4 'Do Not Travel' advisory due to the consequences of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, widespread harassment and wrongful detention of U.S. citizens, restricted embassy support, and the persistent threat of terrorism and civil unrest ([Travel Safety Overview](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/about-our-new-products.html), [Russia Travel Advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/russia-travel-advisory.html)).\n\n[@cr-map]\n\n:::{#cr-map .cr-visible style=\"min-height: 750px;\"}\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 1400px; margin: 0 auto;\">\n<iframe \n  src=\"img/globalmap.html\" \n  width=\"3000\" \n  height=\"750\" \n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  style=\"border:none;\" \n  sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups\">\n</iframe>\n\n</div>\n\n\n:::\n\n\n:::{#cr-mapped .cr-visible style=\"min-height: 700px;\"}\n<div style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 1400px; margin: 0 auto;\">\n  <iframe src=\"img/bubbles_map.html\" \n    width=\"3000\" \n    height=\"750\" \n    loading=\"lazy\"\n    style=\"border:none;\" \n    sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups\">   \n  </iframe>\n</div>\n\n\n\n:::\n\n## U.S. Citizen Deaths and Level 4 Travel Warnings: A Regional Perspective\n[@cr-mapped]\n\nOne of the main reasons for a country to be categorized as a Level 4 advisory is the occurrence of the death of a U.S. citizen overseas. When a U.S. citizen dies abroad, it triggers a formal intervention by U.S. consular officers, who are responsible for notifying next of kin, securing the deceased’s effects, and managing complex legal and logistical challenges ([Estates and Effects of Deceased U.S. Citizens](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/death-abroad1/estates-of-deceased-US-citizens.html)).\n\nTo better understand this relationship, the bubble map below visualizes the regions where deaths have coincided with Level 4 advisories. Average deaths were calculated by aligning incidents that occurred within two years prior to a country's Level 4 designation, ensuring that the measure captures the period of instability leading up to the advisory. Deaths were then grouped by region and standardized to create a clearer comparison across the globe.\n\n## Spotlight on the Americas\n\nThe Americas [@cr-mapped]{pan-to=\"60%,-5%\" scale-by=\"1.8\"}stand out on the map not because of the number of Level 4 countries, but because of the concentrated safety risks within a few destinations. With only two countries, <b>Haiti</b> and <b>Venezuela</b>, under a Level 4 advisory, the region still shows the highest average of 3.8 U.S. citizen deaths per country over the two years leading up to each advisory. Europe and Asia follow closely behind, with averages of 3.4 and 3.2 deaths per country respectively during the same two-year period. These patterns suggest that even when only a few countries are classified as Level 4, the underlying risk to U.S. travelers can remain dangerously high across entire regions.\n\n\n\n:::{#cr-map2 .cr-visible style=\"min-height: 700px;\"}\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 1400px; margin: 0 auto;\">\n  <iframe src=\"img/top_5_aligned_advisories.html\" \n          width=\"3000\" \n          height=\"750\" \n          style=\"border:none;\">    \n  </iframe>\n</div>\n\n\n\n:::\n\n## Third map\n[@cr-map2] Text\n\n:::{#cr-map3 .cr-visible style=\"min-height: 700px;\"}\n\n<div style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 1400px; margin: 0 auto;\">\n  <iframe src=\"img/top_5_misaligned_advisories.html\" \n          width=\"3000\" \n          height=\"750\" \n          style=\"border:none;\"> \n  </iframe>\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n## Fourth map\n[@cr-map3] Some content\n\n::: \n\n## Conclusion\n\nText\n \n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\n## The Anatomy of a Level 4 Travel Advisory: Safety, Economy, and Tourism\n\nTourism plays an important role in a country’s economy, giving travelers the chance to explore new cultures and experiences while supporting local businesses.
